# Contributing to the Spellbook!

This project follows the best practices defined by this [Perl Style Guide](https://heitorgouvea.me/projects/perl-style-guide).

Open a discussion issue before you begin. So we can listen to what you have to say, and we can provide a referral if it will be worth changing big parts of the project. A good start point is to read the [development guide](/wiki/Developer-Guide).

The Spellbook has a public kanban dedicated to representing the status of all project issues and pull requests. Some have a "help wanted" flag, if you are a new contributor you can start with them.
