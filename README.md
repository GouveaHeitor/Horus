### Summary

⚠️ __Warning:__ Spellbook is currently in __development__, you've been warned :) and please consider [contributing!](./github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Here you will find a "spellbook" with my personal scripts, exploits and other small things I wrote during my bug hunts, pentesting or red teaming missions. Like any other spellbook, some things here are not going to be very easy to understand, but like any other spellbook it couldn't be different, right?

The main focus of this "micro-framework" is to keep my personal scripts organized and make them available in a structure where I can reuse the code that has already been written to write something else. Furthermore, the Spellbook is just a research project that so far is no big deal and does not replace a truly robust framework.
